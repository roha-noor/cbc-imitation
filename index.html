<p> I was born March 30th, 2006 to possibly the best parents I could imagine, along with that two older sisters who I wouldn't trade for the world. </p>
 
  
  <div> 
       <p> For the next four years of my life I would be at home doing all possible to occupy myself and kill my boredom. That included wasting hours watching dora the explorer, as any child was doing at the time, and  practcing my handwriting (as per my mothers request).</p>
  
    <h4> Some of my favourite activities as a child included:</h4>
      <ul>
      <li> Play-doh </li>
      <li> Watching TV </li>
      <li> Annoying my family </li>
      </ul>
